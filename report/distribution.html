<p><strong>Construct Statistical Model for Locomotion Distribution</strong></p>
<p>To take a closer look at the tail property of locomotion, we analyze the
moving distance distribution for each string. Fitting those distributions
using some prior knowledge and obtain estimator for each mouse. With
expectation, it is possible to cluster mice by the their unique distribution
estimator, and further figure figure out with strain they belong to.</p>
<p><strong>Main Questions to Answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>What is the distribution model we could use to fit?</li>
<li>How can we estimate parameters for our distribution?</li>
<li>How can we do clustering strains based on model parameters?</li>

<h2>Statement of Statistical Problem:<a class="headerlink" href="#statement-of-statistical-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Distribution Selection</strong></p>
<p>The major statistical question is how to choose fitted distribution
family. Based on conventions and data we have, we propose two
distributions: law decay distribution and exponenital distribution:</p>
<p>In statistics, power law, also known as a pareto, is a functional
relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one
quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other
quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one
quantity varies as a power of another. <span class="math">\(F(x)=kx^{-a}\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a problem with power law or pareto distribution when took
a close look at the distance distribution. This power law decay
only works for monotone decreasing distribution. While it is not
for our case. Therefore, two methods are designed to handle this.</p>
<p>First of all, we proposed to only estimate the powerlaw on the tail
of distribution. Namely, truncate the small unstable distances on
the left tail of distribution. Secondly, the power function may
not be realistic by nature as the observed distribution is not
monotone decreasing. In this case, the distribution is left skewed
with one peak (see exploratory analysis). Thus we can make more
general assumption, such as exponential distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness Comparsion</strong></p>
<p>Previously we proposed two different parametric families and each of
them make sense but we need to have more quantitative evidence to see
the fittness or, hopefully, compare their goodness of fit.</p>
<p>The check of fitness is in needed after obtaining the parameter.
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test enable us to test the fitness of power
law and exponential distribution. For them, we choose the null
to be selected distribution, and if we reject K-S test, we will
conclude the the sample distribution is not familiar with theoretical
distribution; thus, we have enough evidence against our null.</p>
<p>After that, to further compare these two distribution&#8217;s capability
of capturing the pattern of distances, we conducted a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT), with both two to be null hypothesis
consecutively. Moreover, it may be hard to know the exact distribution
of our test statistics and thus extremely hard to calculate the critical
value or p-values. Therefore, we may need simulation methods to estimate
critial value of p-value, and the major question is how can we generate
random number from our fitted model.</p>

<div class="section" id="exploratory-analysis">
<h2>Exploratory Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#exploratory-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The difference between “home base” and “non home base”: &#8220;home base&#8221;,
which means a favored location at which long periods of inactivity
(ISs) occur, is a post defined characteristic of the mouse and it is
classified by its behavior. For instance, if one mice spend about 80%
of the time outside of the nest, then we may conclude it is not home
base and we will cluster it as non-home based mouse. This classification
is not done by one specific mouse, but a strain of mouse. By the
Exploratory Analysis, we will find significant difference between two
classes and hopefully we can make connection about the speed of mice and
its home based or non home based property.</p>
<p>The definition of inter-event distance: literally, inter-event
distance is the distance within one single event. Investigating the
data of the distance between each two consecutive points recorded by
the detector of one mouse day, we found the shape of the histogram is
similar to the plot on the slide, except the value of frequency is
bigger. This inconsistency gives us the motivation to calculate the
inter event distance instead of the distance between each two points.
For this purpose, we need a vector of the index of events for each
mouse day. In particular, the mapping vector is connected by time
since xy coordinates are recorded according to time and the event is
defined based on time.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="alt tag" src="../_images/project6.png" />
</div>
<p>Preferred choice of distribution: the power law is a monotone decreasing,
however our plot indicates a peak. Therefore, we can either choose
differernt parametric distribution family, such as gamma distribution, or
choose a threshold to make our distribution monotonic decreasing. Based on
what Chris said about the sensor, as it will only detect when a mice moves
more than 1cm within in 20ms. It does not make sense to have observations
less than 1cm and outliers needs to be cleaned up. After we put a threshold
with 1cm, we find the distribution is monotonic decreasing and we can fit
power law distribution, as well as exponential distribution.

<h2>Methodology/ Approach Description<a class="headerlink" href="#methodology-approach-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the estimated parameter for each distribution, we can learn more
about its distribution and the information lies mainly in the decay rate
of the tail.</p>
<p>Here are our algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Draw the histogram for our data. For each mouse day, observe the distribution and explore whether our distribution assumption makes sense.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Estimate parameters based on MLE of truncated powerlaw, aka Pareto distribution and truncated exponential.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add the density function to our histogram, see the fitness of our distribution.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Conduct statistical test to quantitatively analysis the fitness. For testing the hypothetical distributions of a given array, there are several existing commonly used methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Kolmogorov–Smirnov test</li>
<li>Cramér–von Mises criterion</li>
<li>Anderson–Darling test</li>
<li>Shapiro–Wilk test</li>
<li>Chi-squared test</li>
<li>Akaike information criterion</li>
<li>Hosmer–Lemeshow test</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However, each approach has their pros and cons. We adopt KS test since the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic quantifies a distance between
the empirical distribution function of the sample and the cumulative distribution function of the reference distribution. We recommend
that all the methods are to be tried to get a comprehensive understanding of the inter-event step distributions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="first">Retrieve data function (<em>retrieve_data</em>): Given the number of mouse
and the date, create a data frame containing follow variables. 1)
position: x,y coordinates 2) time: detecting time stamp for each pair

for active state and inactive state.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Retrieve event function (<em>retrieve_event</em>): Given an event label
(e.g. Food), subset respective part of data from the data frame we
got in <em>retrieve_data</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Compute the distance (<em>compute_distance</em>): Given event label,
compute the distance between each time stamp. As we already know the
x, y coordinates from the dataframe in <em>retrieve_event</em>, the
simplest way to implement this function is that:</p>
<div class="math">
\[distance = ((x_t2 - x_t1)^2+(y_t2 - y_t1)^2)^(1/2)\]</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Draw histogram (<em>draw_histogram</em>): Given a sub-array, using the plt
built-in histogram function to draw the plot. Test distribution
(<em>fit_distr</em>): Given the testing methods (e.g. “ks”), implement the
corresponding fitting methods. The potential output could be p-value
of the hypothesis test.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the potential functions to be implemented, the following is the
guide of testing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>test_retrieve_data</em>: attain a small subset of data from x,y
coordinate and t, and feed in the function. Compare the results with
the counted number.</li>
<li><em>test_retrieve_event</em>: Use the small data frame we get in
test_retrieve_data, given different events/state. Compare the
results with our counted number.</li>
<li><em>test_compute_distance</em>: Given x = 3, y =4, the output should be 5.</li>
<li><em>test_fit_distr</em>: randomly draw samples from widely used
distributions (e.g. uniform). Test it with right(e.g. uniform) and
wrong(e.g. gamma) distributions. Compare the p-values with given
threshold (e.g. alpha = 95%)</li>

<h2>Result<a class="headerlink" href="#result" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We fit the power law and exponential distribution for each mouse day. For each, we got an estimator of alpha for power law and an

Here is an example of strain 0, mouse 2, day 5. From the plot we can see the fitting is pretty well.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Comparsion Between truncated Exponential and Powerlaw (Pareto) distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>One major question we want to answer: which distribution fits better,
truncated exponential or truncated power law, aka pareto, distribution.
To measure the distribution of the speed, the major difference is the
tail distribution. You can also see it from the fitted plot. Both exponential
distribution and pareto distribution fits quite well and they are actually
very similar with each other, and the difference is barely noticeable.
Therefore, it is hard to simply tell which distribution fits better. However,
although the distribution is quite similar at the beginning, it diverse in
the tail distribution. For exponential distribution, the tail decays with
the rate e^{-x}, which is much faster than that of pareto distribution
x^{-a}. Therefore, the goodness of fit is mainly determined by the tail
distribution. We tried Kolmogorov test to determine whether our sample
fits the theoretical distribution, but it does not compare two distributions.</p>
<p>To make comparison between two distributions, we used Generalized
Likelihood Ratio Test to do hypothesis testing. As we cannot actually
treat different distribution equally, with that being said, to do hypothesis
testing, we must have null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis, where
we tend to protect it and only reject when the we have strong evidence
against it. Thus, we will conduct two hypothesis testings, with null being
either exponential or power law distribution. We will expect there to be
three possible outcomes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Exponential null rejected but power law null not rejected. In this case, we conclude power law is better than exponential.</li>
<li>Power law null rejected but exponential null not rejected. In this case, we conclude exponential is better than power law.</li>
<li>Both two tests not rejected. In this case, we conclude both two fits similarly and there is no one significantly better than another.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Although theoretically we should consider the case when both two tests
are rejected, it is highly unlikely this thing happens. Because rejecting
both two means we have enough evidence to say exponential is better
and power law is also better, while not rejecting two might happen, as
we tends to protect the null and if they react similarly, we don’t have
enough evidence to reject any of them.</p>
<p>Here is the algorithm to conduct the test. The GLRT test statistics is the
ratio of likelihood, with numerator being likelihood under null set while
that under alternative in numerator. It is intuitively right that we shall reject
the null if our test statistics is too small. To make the significance level
being 0.05, it is essential to find the critical value. However, it is hard for
us to derive the distribution of test statistics and thus we use simulation
to estimate it. Thus, we draw random number from null distribution and
then calculate the test statistics. Also, p-value is a better statistics and it
will not only tell us whether we should reject the null, but also tell us what
is the confidence that we reject the null.</p>
<p>From the outcome of our function, we actually find the p-value from
exponential null is very close to 1, while that from power law null is very
Small, next to 0.0005. This is a strong evidence that we should not think
power law is a better fit than exponential. Thus, we conclude that we should
use exponential to fit and do further research.</p>

<h2>Mann-Whitney U test on distances:<a class="headerlink" href="#mann-whitney-u-test-on-distances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the distribution of distances, we perform a hypothesis test on the distributions of these distances. The goal is to identify some similarity on mice in the same strain when only looking at the distances covered every second.</p>
<p>To do so we chose a non parametric test since we only have access to sample distributions. The Kolmogorov Smirnov test is a very popular test used in this case but I chose to explore the Mann-Whitney U test instead for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The KS test is sensitive to any differences in the two distributions. Substantial differences in shape, spread or median will result in a small P value. (see here for more details). Here we can feel that the distances have high variance. Therefore, the KS test would be too strict for our study.</li>
<li>In contrast, the MW test is mostly sensitive to changes in the median, which is less sensitive of noise in the case of mice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MannWhitney U test is a test for assessing whether two independent samples come from the same distribution. The null hypothesis for this test is that the two groups have the same distribution, while the alternative hypothesis is that one group has larger (or smaller) values than the other.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(H_0$: $P(X&gt;Y)=P(Y&gt;X)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(H_1$: $P(X&gt;Y)\neq P(Y&gt;X)\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">MW U test p-values for mice within the same strains. Dark blue is close to 1 and very light blue is close to zero.</span></p>
</div>
<p>From the figures above, we notice that in terms of p-values, strain 1 is closer to strain 0 than strain 2. But we also notice that the p-values are still very low, which means that there is evidence for rejecting <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span>. Moreover, when looking closer within each strain of mice, we can see that mice have different distributions too. Therefore, based on the inter-distances,  we cannot conclude that mice behave similarly depending on their strains.</p>

<div class="section" id="further-work">
<h2>Further Work:<a class="headerlink" href="#further-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here are some further research we could do. However, because of
Incomplete sample we have, we cannot do it for now, but it is easy
to fix the function</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>K means clustering:</li>
</ul>
<p>One major goal of this project is to measure
similarity between different strain and hopefully make clusters based
on our data. But one difficulty is that we cannot plug in the information
we have to a known machine learning clustering algorithm. However,
as truncated exponential to be a good fit. We can use the parameters
to measure the similarity and transform our sample data to one scalar.
One classic unsupervised learning algorithm is K-means and we can
definitely use it to make clusters. However, one drawback is the distance
between our parameters is not uniform but as long as there exists
significant difference, it will not harm that much.</p>
